SMS Spam Classifier – Read Me

This project is a machine learning application that detects whether an SMS message is Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
It uses Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn for building and deploying the model.

Files in this project:

app.py – Main Streamlit app file.

SMS_Classification.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook for training the model.

spam_sms.csv – Dataset containing SMS messages with spam/ham labels.

model.pkl – Saved trained ML model.

vectorizer.pkl – Saved text vectorizer for converting text into numerical features.

requirements.txt – List of Python dependencies.

.streamlit/ – Streamlit configuration folder.

.devcontainer/, .idea/, __pycache__/ – Environment and cache files.

How to run the app locally:

Install Python (version 3.8+ recommended).

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app:

streamlit run app.py


Open the local URL shown in the terminal.

Usage:

Type or paste an SMS message in the text box.

Click Predict.

The app will display whether it’s Spam or Ham.

If you retrain the model using the notebook, replace model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl with the new ones.
